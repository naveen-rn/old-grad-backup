GOAL:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cluster the Netflix movies using K-means clustering. 
You are given a set of movies and a list of which eview which rater 
has given to which movies. Your goal is to create four hundred or so
sets of related movies. 

Other goals include,

1. Understand the K-means and canopy clustering algorithms and their 
   relationship
2. Implement these algorithms in MapReduce
3. Analyze the effect of running these algorithms on a large data set

How to run the scripts?

The scripts are provided in the scripts/ directory. The scripts are
created to run from a local system. Please, modify the scripts for the
cluster or some other virtual machines accordingly.

What is the build.xml?

build.xml is the major build file, it will build all the source codes
which are available in the src/ directory.

What are the source files in the src/ directory?

The src/ directory contains the main source files. There are four
files:
1. NetFlixAnalysisDataAggregate.java - This for data modification for
the first step.
2. NetFlixAnalysisCanopyData.java - This for the canopy selection for
the second step.
3. NetFlixAnalysisCanopyMovies.java - This for the canopy distance
calculation for the third step.
4. NetFlixKMeans.java - This is the KMeans mapreduce algorithm


How to run the program?

1. untar the files
2. ant build or ant
3. if the build is successful, you will get a build folder with the
BUILD SUCCESSFUL message
4. to run in a local machine, create a directory named input and place
the sample input files in it. (sample input directory is provided)
5. source ./scripts/runscripts
6. now the outputs of all the steps are generated as separate
directory

What are docs?

Please refer the docs directory for the various documents related to
the data structure and other related steps
