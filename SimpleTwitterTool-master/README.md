<b>miniTweet 0.1</b>

miniTweet is basically a python script to tweet from the terminal. The
main objective of this script is to make twitter usage from the
terminal as simple as possible. For a developer (like me ;)) the
console is the whole world and it would be easier to post tweets
without shifting windows between multiple browsers. 

At present, the script includes the following options:<br>
1. you can post directly<br>
2. you can look at the recent tweets from your friends<br>

The following items are there in the to-do list:<br>
1. Retweet and like<br>
2. short-url introduction<br>
3. searching for any particuler friend/following to be added in the
   tweet<br>
4. streaming input variations to jump from post to get tweets and
   so<br>

How to make it work:<br>
Modify the develeoper_detail.py file with the developer details
add the main.py file lcoation to the ~/.bashrc
export PATH="location of main.py":$PATH
