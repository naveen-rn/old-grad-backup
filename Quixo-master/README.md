A program that will allow two players to play the game of Quixo.

The game uses twenty five cubes where each cube has a face with a cross,
a face with a circle, and blank faces. The game starts with the cubes
placed with blank face up in five rows and five columns.

One player choses to play with circles, the other with crosses. Also, one of
them decides to go first.

The objective of the game is for a player to place five symbols in line 
(horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Which ever player meets this 
objective first wins. If in your turn you also help the other player place
his/her symbols in line, then the other player wins.

Each player takes turn to play. A player may (re)move a blank faced cube or 
one with his/her symbol on it from the periphery. They can never remove a cube 
with an opponent's symbol facing up.

A player plays his/her turn by removing a cube (with bank face or own symbol)
from the periphery. Once a cube is removed, the player can push adjacent cubes
in any one direction to make way in the end for the removed cube to be placed. 
The removed cube is now placed back in the end, but with player's symbol 
facing up. A player is not allowed to replace a cube back where it was taken 
from. If the player took the cube in a corner, there are two locations where 
it can be placed. If the cube is taken from the side, then there are three 
locations where it can be placed.

At anytime a player may abandon the game or start over with a new game. Once
a game completes, player can't make any more move, but can start a new game.
