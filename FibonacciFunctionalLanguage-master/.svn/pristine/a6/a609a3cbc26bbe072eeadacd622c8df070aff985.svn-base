Files you check in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. 
Each of you are expected to put in your reasonable share of effort into it.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat.

Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. So, if you break code (in assignments) before the deadline, you will lose.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews (see the readme.txt file in the reviews folder for details on how to ask for reviews).

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews to your pair and to other pairs in the course.
Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.

Now to the assignment #1.
====================================================================================================================

Assign1 Due 11:59PM September 19th

For this assignment we will use three different languages. One has to be a statically typed language.
One has to be a dynamically typed languages. Do not pick two languages that are too similar to each other.

In each of the language, create one or more functions to compute the Fibonacci series. Given a position, 
where position is > 0, the functions will produce a series up to that position. For example, given position
6, it will produce a series of values 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 

If you choose a language that permits mutability, write one of the functions to use mutability.
In addition, write a function that honors total immutability.
Then write a function that uses recursion.

For each language, create code with appropriate extensions. Create a gradle build file and/or a sh (or cmd)
file that will compile (if necessary) and run the code.

Suggestion: Start with one language. Write the code in that languages, evolve it using reviews. Once you've completed code in one language (and gotten a satisfactory review), then create in another language.

After completing the coding (and only after that), answer the following questions:

1. Discuss some of the things you have learned from working on this assignment.

Replace this line with your answer.

2. Where there any thing that surprised you or things that you did not expect.

Replace this line with your answer.

3. Give this experience, draw a comparison of the three languages used.

Replace this line with your answer.
