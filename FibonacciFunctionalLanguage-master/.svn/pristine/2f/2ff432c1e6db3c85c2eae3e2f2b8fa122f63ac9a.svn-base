Files you check in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. 
Each of you are expected to put in your reasonable share of effort into it.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat.

Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. So, if you break code (in assignments) before the deadline, you will lose.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews (see the readme.txt file in the reviews folder for details on how to ask for reviews).

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews to your pair and to other pairs in the course.
Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.

Now to the assignment #1.
====================================================================================================================

Assign1 Due 11:59PM September 19th

For this assignment we will use three different languages. One has to be a statically typed language.
One has to be a dynamically typed languages. Do not pick two languages that are too similar to each other.

In each of the language, create one or more functions to compute the Fibonacci series. Given a position, 
where position is > 0, the functions will produce a series up to that position. For example, given position
6, it will produce a series of values 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 

If you choose a language that permits mutability, write one of the functions to use mutability.
In addition, write a function that honors total immutability.
Then write a function that uses recursion.

For each language, create code with appropriate extensions. Create a gradle build file and/or a sh (or cmd)
file that will compile (if necessary) and run the code.

Suggestion: Start with one language. Write the code in that languages, evolve it using reviews. Once you've completed code in one language (and gotten a satisfactory review), then create in another language.

After completing the coding (and only after that), answer the following questions:

1. Discuss some of the things you have learned from working on this assignment.

We learned many things while completing this assignment. To begin with, we got acquainted with two new languages scala and erlang. 
Programming in a complete immutable and functional language like Erlang was good learning experience. 
This assignment also taught us that just writing a correct, efficient code is not good programming practice.
A good program should always be correct, concise, less noisy and more readable. And we are glad we know how to do that now.

2. Where there any thing that surprised you or things that you did not expect.

Yes. Reviews always surprised us. While writing code we would anticipate the review, but it would be something different always. 
Also, we did not expect that writing a non-recursive function can actually be more difficult than writing a recursive one.
Fibonacci in Erlang - no loops, no recursion. It was difficult to believe its even possible. But only then we realized the power of that language. 
Here we also realized that we could survive without a lot of things we think are mandatory!

3. Give this experience, draw a comparison of the three languages used.
Java - Object oriented, Mutable, Static and Strong typed language. Code is more ceremonious and has statements. We have to specify the type of variable or function return explicitly to declare them. 

Scala - Both mutable and immutable, Static and Strong typed language. Code is less ceremonious compared to Java and has expressions. Supports the match-case feature which makes programming a lot simpler. We do not have to specify type information.

Erlang - Immutable, Dynamic and Strong typed language. Code is not so ceremonious. Does not contain loops.
